# JavaScript Learning Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Projects repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my JavaScript learning endeavors, including projects, code snippets, and study materials. It's organized into four main sections to help you navigate through various JavaScript concepts and practices.

I'm currently learning JavaScript with guidance from the following lecture, presented by 코드팩토리: https://youtu.be/ZOVG7_41kJE?si=0sfpKkmfQlob5TcJ
