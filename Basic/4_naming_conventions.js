/**
 * Naming Conventions 1 (Must Follow)
 * 1. Use only English letters and numbers for names.
 * 2. Only the underscore (_) and dollar sign ($) are allowed as special characters.
 * 3. Names cannot start with a number.
 * 4. Keywords cannot be used as names (e.g., var var = 'test';).

/**
 * Naming Conventions 2 (Strongly Recommended, following programmer's rules):
 * If you use more than one word for a variable name, follow these rules:
 * 1. camelCase - Start with a lowercase letter, and use uppercase for the first letter of each subsequent word (recommended in JS).
 * 2. snake_case - Use underscores (_) to connect words (recommended in Python).
 * 3. PascalCase - Start each word with an uppercase letter (recommended in C#).
